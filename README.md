# ListboxAlias
Powershell WPF \ GUI form. Listbox form with defined aliases for each entry. The form then takes the alias of your selected listbox-item and edits\changes lines you define in a file you define. Used when users need to edit configuration-files and you want to eliminate user-error\typo(ooopsie)'s etc. Hope you find it useful.
